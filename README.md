Following Set of Contributions have been made in this project based on work: 
 We analyze the sequential and sentimental properties
and relationships among texts of the email using
Word-Embeddings and Bidirectional Long Short Term
Memormy(Bi-LSTM).
 We speed up trainning time involving Convolutional
Nueral Network before the Bi-LSTM network and also
extract higher level features of texts using this network
within a less time compared to straight LSTM network.
 To evaluate the performance of the proposed approach,
we used liangspam and spam text message classification
datasets computing precision, recall and f-score. Our
model outperforms to some popular machine learning
algorithm and also to some recent approaches used to
detect spam messages.
